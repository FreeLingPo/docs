>#### Introduction

This is an introduction edited by an idle person who has nothing to do, of course, the program is not played by me, by Mizuhara37, my buddy grunts all night, grunts out (all night grunts have lost several hairs, support it!). ï¼‰

We'll be adding more stuff in the future, so look forward to it!

> Development progress ###

Contrail Online is still in its initial stage, both in terms of interface and functionality will be slightly abbreviated, after all, the developers are currently in a relatively stressful learning environment, and can only update it on weekends when they have free time to do their homework.

Full development is expected to be completed in July 2023, and at the time of writing in October 2022, nearly a year's development cycle.
