>#### Introduction

This is an introduction edited by a person with nothing better to do. Of course, the program is not typed by me, but by Mizuhara37, my good friend Goo Goo Goo all night long (Goo Goo Goo all night long has lost several hairs, support it!)

We will add more things in the future, so look forward to it!

>#### Development progress

Contrail Online is still in its initial stage, both in terms of interface and functionality will be slightly abbreviated, after all, the developers are currently in a relatively stressful learning environment, and can only update it on weekends when they have free time to do their homework.

Full development is expected to be completed in July 2023, and at the time of writing in October 2022, nearly a year's development cycle.
